    <h2>Clara Aguasviva</h2>
    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p>Hi there! I was born in the Dominican Republic, but came to the U.S. as an infant. My faith is extremely
        important to me as I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses. I love helping people in any way I can. I also love animals.
        I own three dogs.</p>
